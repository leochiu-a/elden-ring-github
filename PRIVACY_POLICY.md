# Elden Ring GitHub Privacy Policy

Elden Ring GitHub does not collect, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information, financial data, authentication information, communication contents, location data, or browsing history.

The extension stores only user preferences (banner display settings and sound preferences) locally on the user's browser using Chrome's storage API. These preferences are not shared with any third party and are never transmitted over the internet.

Elden Ring GitHub does not access, read, or store any GitHub repository contents, code, or private information beyond detecting merge events on GitHub pages.

No data collected by the extension is used for analytics, advertising, or any purpose beyond the extension's single function of displaying celebration banners when pull requests are merged.

The extension only operates on GitHub.com pages and does not track or monitor any other websites or browsing activities.
